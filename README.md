# Stock Price Analyzer

This was one of my first data projects where I wanted to get more comfortable working with real-world data and building simple web apps. I’ve always been curious about how stock prices move, so I thought it’d be interesting to create a tool that lets you explore that interactively.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Work with APIs using `yfinance` to pull real-time data
- Clean and manipulate data using `pandas`
- Plot charts with `matplotlib`
- Build and deploy an app using Streamlit

---

## What It Does
- Type in any stock symbol (like `AAPL` or `TSLA`)
- Choose a start and end date to analyze performance
- View a chart of the closing prices with a 20-day moving average
- Check out the raw stock data in a table

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- yfinance
- pandas
- matplotlib
